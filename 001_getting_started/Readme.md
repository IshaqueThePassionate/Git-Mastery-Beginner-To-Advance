## Step 1: Installing Git

### Windows

#### Download the Git Installer:
- Visit the [Git for Windows website](https://gitforwindows.org/).
- Download the latest version of the Git installer.

  ```bash
  git --version
  ```
- You should see the Git version number displayed, indicating that Git is installed successfully.

### macOS

#### Using Homebrew (recommended):
- If you don't have Homebrew installed, run this command in the Terminal to install it:
  ```bash
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```
- Once Homebrew is installed, install Git by running:
  ```bash
  brew install git
  ```

#### Verify the Installation:
- Open the Terminal and type:
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```
- You should see the Git version number displayed, indicating that Git is installed successfully.

### Linux

#### Using a Package Manager:

For Debian-based distributions (e.g., Ubuntu), run:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

For RPM-based distributions (e.g., Fedora), run:
```bash
sudo dnf install git
```

#### Verify the Installation:
- Open the Terminal and type:
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```
- You should see the Git version number displayed, indicating that Git is installed successfully.

## Step 2: Configuring Git

After installing Git, you need to configure it with your personal information. This information will be used for your commits.

### Set Your Username:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

### Set Your Email Address:
```bash
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Verify Your Configuration:
- To verify your configuration, use the following command:
  ```bash
  git config --list
  ```
- This command will display the current configuration, including your username and email.

## Step 3: Getting Help

Git provides a built-in help system to assist you with commands and their usage.

### Basic Help Command:
- To get help about any Git command, use:
  ```bash
  git help <command>
  ```
- Example, to get help with the `commit` command:
  ```bash
  git help commit
  ```

### Alternative Help Commands:
You can also use the following commands to access help:
```bash
git <command> --help
```
or
```bash
git <command> -h
```

### Git Documentation:
- For comprehensive documentation, visit the [official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).
